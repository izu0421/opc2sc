### Section 1. Preprocessing of OPCs during injury and in controls

The data was first aligned using cellranger. The count matrices were processed using Scanpy:

1. [Dataset preprocessing and removal of low-quality cells](https://www.yizhouyu.com/opc2sc/scripts/0_1_dataset_formatting_invivo_counts.html)
2. [Regressing out ["total_counts", "pct_counts_mt","pct_counts_ERCC"]](https://www.yizhouyu.com/opc2sc/scripts/1_1_dataset_formatting_regressout.html)

Cell states (also referred to as cell types) were annotated based on the regressed-out dataset.
3. [Cell state annodation](https://www.yizhouyu.com/opc2sc/scripts/1_2_invivo_celltype_annodation_regressoutdataset.html)
4. [Plot gene markers](https://www.yizhouyu.com/opc2sc/scripts/1_3_gene_marker_plotting.html)
