### Figures 4 and 7 - UK Biobank analysis of MTHFD2L SNPs and folate intake in AD patients and controls

This folder contains only the analysis scripts. Please contack the UK Biobank ([link](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)) to obtain data access. We are happy to transfer the processed data upon approval from the UK Biobank.

### Figure 5 - Single-cell RNA sequencing of neurons from AD and controls, and single-cell mendelian randomisation of MTHFD2L in neurons

This folder contains script for single cell RNA analysis of MTHFD2L expression. The raw data is obtained from the [cellxgene platform](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/b953c942-f5d8-434f-9da7-e726ba7c1481). All anlaysis scripts are in the folder. This folder also contains the data for the single cell Mendelian randomisation analyses i.e. the eQTLs for *MTHFD2L* expression, harmonised data and the scripts for plotting. 

These are the folders of the analyses

### Figure 6 & 8 - High-throughput analysis of sleep and lifespan in Abeta-expressing flies fed with folate

This folder contains the raw data data from Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAM2) and the scripts for the subsequent analyses.
